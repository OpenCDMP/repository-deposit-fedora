# Repository Deposit Fedora for OpenCDMP

**repository-deposit-fedora** is an implementation of the [repository-deposit-base](https://github.com/OpenCDMP/repository-deposit-base) package that enables the deposition of **OpenCDMP Plans** into the [Fedora](https://fedorarepository.org/) repository, automatically minting a **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)** for each deposited plan.

## Overview

This service integrates with the OpenCDMP platform to provide deposit functionality for Fedora, a widely-used open-access research repository. Users can deposit their plans to Fedora, making them citeable, publicly available, and preservable with a permanent DOI.

**Supported operations:**
- ✅ Deposit plans to Fedora
- ✅ Automatic DOI minting
- ✅ System-based and user-based depositions

## Quick start

This service implements the following endpoints as per `DepositController`

### API endpoints

- `POST /deposit` - Deposit a plan to Fedora
- `GET /configuration` - Get repository configuration
- `GET /logo` - Get Fedora logo (base64)

### Example

- **Deposit with System Credentials (Username, Password)**
```bash
 # Uses a system-wide credenitals configured by the service when authInfo is null.
 # No user action is required.

 POST /deposit
  {
    "planModel": {...},
    "authInfo": null
  }
```

- **Deposit with User Credentials (from OpenCDMP profile settings)**
```bash
 # The user has stored their credentials in their OpenCDMP profile settings (see https://opencdmp.github.io/user-guide/profile-settings/#external-plugin-settings).
 # Username, Password credentials are persistent and remains valid until the user updates it in their profile.

 POST /deposit
  {
    "planModel": {...},
    "authInfo": {
        "authFields": [
            {
                "code": "fedora-username"
                "textValue": "username"
            },
            {
                "code": "fedora-password"
                "textValue": "password"
            }
        ]
    } 
  }
```


- **Deposit a new version of an existing plan**
```bash
 # Same as case 1 (system credentials).
 # previousDOI is mandatory to indicate that this is a new version of an existing deposit in this repository.

 POST /deposit
  {
    "planModel": {
        "id": "plan-uuid",
        "title": "My Research Plan",
        "description": "Plan content",
        "previousDOI": "doi"
        // more
    },
    "authInfo": null
  }
